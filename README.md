# Simple Store Cart

This is a simple project that simulates an online Store Cart. It's built using the technologies below:

 - React JS
 - Bootstrap
 - PHP
 - MySQL
 
## What does it do?
It works exactly like any onle store cart does, except 'cause here you register your own products. you can't create, edit and delete products. You can also increase or decrease the amount of a product, and watch its total price and your cart total price in real time.

## Details
- The frontend is built with React JS using Context API and also few libs like React Toastfy, Axios and React Icons.
- The CSS is mobile-first and resposive, using Bootstrap.
- The backend is built with PHP and MySQL database, all comunication is made via Rest API.
