# Simple Store Cart

This is a simple project that simulates an online Store Cart. It's built using the technologies below:

 - React JS
 - Bootstrap
 - PHP
 - MySQL
 
## What does it do?
It works exactly like any onle store cart does, except 'cause here you register your own products. you can't create, edit and delete products. You can also increase or decrease the amount of a product, and watch its total price and your cart total price in real time.

## Demo

It's live, and you can see an online demo [here.](https://maycowmoura.tk/store-cart/)
